Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?
So far, I've built the basic structure of the character creation tool using Tkinter, with inputs for hair color, eye color, skin tone, clothing, and expression. I’ve added a color picker for easy color selection and implemented a simple drawing of the character based on these attributes. The program also includes a random character generator. 
#### What have you not done for your project yet?
What's left is to add more customization options like hairstyles, expressions, and clothing, improve the drawing's detail, and implement error handling for invalid inputs.
#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
So far, the main problems I've encountered are ensuring valid input for colors and handling invalid or unexpected inputs from the user. I’ve also faced challenges with making the character drawing more detailed and realistic, as well as integrating more advanced customization options within the time constraints.
