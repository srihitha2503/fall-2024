# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Digital Detective: Draw Your Suspect

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
In my project, I created an interactive character creation tool where users can customize a digital character's appearance by choosing features like hair color, eye color, skin tone, clothing, expression, and hairstyle. Using a simple Tkinter interface, users can design their own characters and view the drawing, with the option to randomly generate characters for added fun.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In my project, I developed an interactive character creation tool that allows users to design their own digital characters by customizing a variety of attributes. The software provides a simple, user-friendly interface where users can select different features for their character, such as hair color, eye color, skin tone, clothing color, hairstyle, expression, and gender. 

One of the main features of the software is the color picker, which allows users to easily choose their desired colors for the character’s features using a built-in color chooser dialog. Users can manually enter text inputs for other attributes like expression or hairstyle, making the character truly customizable. Additionally, there’s a button to randomly generate a character, which adds an element of surprise and fun. The program uses a series of functions to draw and update the character on a canvas widget, with each feature being drawn in the specified color or style. Overall, this project serves as an engaging and fun tool for designing characters and experimenting with different visual styles.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.



### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?


A good outcome for my final project will be the creation of an interactive character design tool that allows users to customize a character's appearance (including hair, eyes, skin tone, and expression), view the character as a drawing, and generate random characters. Even if time constraints limit some advanced features, I will prioritize making the core character creation process intuitive and functional.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for my project would be to implement character customization with options for different outfits, hairstyles, and expressions, along with a random character generator. 
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for my project would be to create a fully functional character design tool with advanced customization options, including various outfits, hairstyles, expressions, and accessories. I would also integrate a polished, user-friendly interface, smooth random character generation, color pickers, and robust error handling, making the app both intuitive and visually appealing.
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Since I'm working alone, my next steps will involve refining both the functionality and user interface of the character creation tool. To achieve the best outcome, I'll need to deepen my knowledge of Tkiner, particularly for creating more complex visual elements like custom shapes or images for additional accessories (e.g., hats, glasses). I'll also need to research error handling to ensure that user inputs are validated properly, especially for color selections, text entries, and custom features. 
Ultimately, my goal is to integrate all these improvements into a polished, user-friendly tool that allows for easy character creation and customization. I will prioritize learning these new skills and applying them as I move forward with the project.
